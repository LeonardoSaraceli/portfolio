I started programming to change career, I believe I always liked the idea but I didn't know exactly how it worked. After researching a lot, I discovered the area of ​​web development and realized that it would be the best opportunity to join, as I already had knowledge of HTML and CSS. So I decided to specialize through an intensive bootcamp, in which I had the opportunity to graduate from Boolean, a course in which I learned the tools necessary to create a web application. Today, I'm looking for a place where I can add, learn and grow more and more as a developer.",
