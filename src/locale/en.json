I currently work at Bydas, focusing on e-commerce platforms with technologies like JavaScript, React, Node.js, PHP, and Shopify's Liquid. I'm also building AlgaID, a mobile app for algae identification, where I've led front-end development with React Native, API design in PHP, database setup in SQLite, and machine learning integration using Python and Google Cloud Vertex AI. I'm always exploring new tools like Next.js, Docker, and Java â€” and outside of coding, I'm passionate about chess.",
