I recently completed a 6-month, full-time intensive bootcamp at Boolean UK, dedicating over 1,000 hours to building my Full-Stack Development skills with JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. Alongside my freelance work, I also took part in a 4-week project that gave me hands-on experience with Agile methodologies and Git workflows. Now, I'm excited to keep learning, growing, and contributing as a developer in a dynamic environment.",
